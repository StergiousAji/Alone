# Alone

Alone is a top-down zombie shooter game with only one objective: survive for as long as possible. The player will be armed with only one weapon and must fight never-ending hordes of zombies.

The game currently features 2 levels set in locations in New York City with the second level ramping up the difficulty considerably from the first. \
The player has to navigate the map and kill all enemies that spawn near them. Ammo will be sparse around the map and so the player is forced to play strategically to get a high score in the game. A score will be calculated when the player dies in the game, encouraging the player to replay the game to obtain a higher score. 
The play areas are restricted in size to induce a claustrophobic and intense atmosphere. Survival and strategy will be the key to achieving a high score in **Alone**.
