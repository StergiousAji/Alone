					     		   ALONE


ALONE is a zombie survival, top-down shooter game. 

The aim of the game is to survive and eliminate as many zombies, that appear randomly on the map, as possible, without dying. Your score increases as you eliminate the zombies, however so does the difficulty. 

When you run out of ammunition (Displayed in the bottom-right corner), Ammunition Refill Boxes will arrive at a random location on the map. Your ammunition will refill when you collect them. 
Each time you happen to run out of ammuintion, you get a chance to receive one more box for every Ammo Box that is dropped. (1 in 10 chance in Level 1 | 1 in 30 chance in Level 2)
